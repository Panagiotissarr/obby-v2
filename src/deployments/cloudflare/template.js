> **Obsidian's desktop app — running in your browser, no Electron needed.**

**This is a demo vault.** Create your own from the vault switcher.

This is a live demo of **Markport** (formerly obsidian-web), an open-source project that runs Obsidian's original renderer in a standard browser by replacing every Capacitor/Electron dependency with lightweight browser-native shims.

**Everything works in the browser:** edit notes, create folders, rename files. Your changes are stored **locally in your browser** (via [OPFS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system)) — private to you and never sent to a server. They survive a page reload and stick around until you clear this site's browsing data.

**One exception:** your notes are never involved, but requests to \`github.com\`, \`githubusercontent.com\`, and \`obsidian.md\` — installing a community plugin, or the one automatic check Obsidian itself makes for deprecated plugins when the vault loads — pass through a small proxy on our server, since the browser can't reach those hosts directly (see [[How It Works]] for the details). A sync server you connect, or any other host, is never routed through it — that traffic is a direct connection from your browser.

## Things to try

- **Edit this note** — click the pencil icon above to switch to edit mode
- **Create a new note** — click the "new note" icon in the file tree
- **Quick open** — \`Ctrl+O\` (or \`Cmd+O\` on Mac)
- **Command palette** — \`Ctrl+P\` (or \`Cmd+P\`)
- **Search** — \`Ctrl+Shift+F\` for full-text search
- **Backlinks** — open [[How It Works]] and check the backlinks panel
- **Graph view** — click the graph icon in the left sidebar

> **Note:** this vault is **yours alone** — it lives only in this browser's local storage (OPFS), is never sent to a server, and nobody else can see it. Edit, delete, or recreate anything freely. (The one exception — GitHub/obsidian.md requests, not your vault content — is explained above.)

  ['How It Works.md', `# How It Works

**Markport** runs Obsidian's original renderer code (\`app.js\`) completely unmodified — byte-for-byte identical to Obsidian's own Android bundle, zero build-time patches. Instead of forking Obsidian, we replace the Capacitor/Node.js/Electron APIs it depends on with browser-compatible shims, and adjust platform behaviour (mobile vs. desktop layout) at runtime via \`client-mobile/platform-bridge.js\`, which intercepts \`Object.defineProperty\` instead of touching a single byte of \`app.js\`.

## Architecture

\`\`\`
Browser
├── client-mobile/shims/       ← replace Capacitor/Node APIs
│   ├── capacitor-shim.js      ← Capacitor.Plugins.* → OPFS store / HTTP / Web APIs
│   ├── path.js, os.js, url.js, btime.js  ← POSIX-ish utilities
│   └── sync-http.js           ← synchronous XHR where Obsidian needs it
├── client-mobile/storage/
│   └── opfs-store.js          ← the vault engine backing this demo (OPFS)
├── client-mobile/boot.js      ← installs window.require, opens the vault
└── obsidian-mobile/app.js     ← Obsidian's code, completely untouched
\`\`\`

## This demo: browser-only storage (OPFS)

This deployment (Cloudflare Pages + a small edge Worker) does **not** store your vault anywhere on a server — there is no database and no per-visitor server-side state:

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Worker** (\`index.js\`) | Serves the static app bundle. Two exceptions: \`POST /api/proxy-request\` — a CORS-safe proxy that routes requests to \`github.com\`, \`githubusercontent.com\`, and \`obsidian.md\` (community-plugin installs, plus one automatic deprecated-plugins check on vault load) — and the \`/starter\`, \`/vault/*\` SPA-fallback routes. A sync server or any other host is never routed through the proxy |
| **OPFS** | The [Origin Private File System](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system) — a private, sandboxed filesystem the browser gives this site. Your vault's files live there, on your device |
| **Seed** | On first visit, this demo vault's files are copied into your own OPFS vault once (client-side, \`seed-example-vault.js\`) — after that, it's just your vault |

There is no server-side database and no cross-tab WebSocket sync in this deployment — everything above lives entirely in your browser's OPFS.

## The shim approach

When Obsidian calls a Capacitor \`Filesystem\` method, \`capacitor-shim.js\` intercepts it. In this deployment it routes straight to \`opfs-store.js\` (browser-local, no network); the same shim can instead call an HTTP \`/api/fs\` backend when running against the optional Node server — Obsidian's own code never knows the difference.

Key shims:
- **Filesystem** (Capacitor) — \`readFile\`, \`writeFile\`, \`stat\`, \`readdir\`, \`mkdir\`, \`rmdir\`, \`rename\`, \`copy\`, \`deleteFile\` — OPFS-backed here, HTTP-backed on the optional Node server
- **Clipboard / Browser / Preferences** — delegate straight to Web APIs (\`navigator.clipboard\`, \`window.open\`, \`localStorage\`)
- **path / os / url** — standard POSIX-ish implementations

## Code Blocks

\`\`\`typescript

## Tables

| Feature       | Node Server | This demo (Browser/OPFS) |
|---------------|:-----------:|:------------------------:|
| FS API        | ✅ (HTTP)    | ✅ (local, no network)    |
| WebSocket     | ✅           | ❌ (not needed — one tab, no server round-trip) |
| Persistent    | ✅ (real files) | ✅ (until you clear site data) |
| Private       | depends on your setup | ✅ (never leaves your browser) |
| Global CDN    | ❌           | ✅ (static assets only)   |

## Blockquote

> Obsidian's renderer runs untouched in the browser.
> Only the Capacitor/Node.js APIs are replaced with browser-native shims (OPFS in this demo).

## Callouts

> [!info] How this works
> This note is rendered by Obsidian's real Markdown pipeline — CodeMirror for editing, their custom renderer for preview. We don't reimplement anything.

> [!info] Demo vault
> This vault is private to your browser. Clearing this site's browsing data is the only thing that removes it. Create your own notes to experiment!

Obsidian's killer feature — bidirectional links between notes.

## Internal Links

- [[Welcome]] — back to start
- [[How It Works]] — architecture
- [[Features/Markdown Showcase]] — formatting examples

## Link with alias

[[Welcome|Back to the welcome page]] — same note, different display text.

## Backlinks Panel

Open this note and click the **backlinks icon** in the right sidebar. You'll see every note that links here.

Notes linking to this page:
- [[Welcome]] (from the notes list)
- [[Features/Markdown Showcase]] (from the bottom navigation)

## Outgoing Links

The **outgoing links** panel shows all links *from* this note to other notes.

## Unresolved Links

[[A Note That Does Not Exist]] — Obsidian highlights unresolved links in a different color. Click it to create the note.

  ['Features/Tags.md', `# Tags

Tags in Obsidian let you categorize notes without a rigid folder structure.

## Inline Tags

Use \`#tagname\` anywhere in a note: #features #tags #demo

## Tag Pane

Open the **Tag Pane** from the left sidebar to see all tags in the vault and how many notes use each one.

## Nested Tags

#features/markdown
#features/links
#features/tags

Nested tags appear as a hierarchy in the tag pane.
