# Markport

Run Obsidian in a standard browser - no Electron, no native app needed.

> **Formerly `obsidian-web`.** Renamed to avoid a name that could be mistaken for an official Obsidian product. Obsidian's [naming guidance for community plugins and themes](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/Manifest#name) follows the same principle. `mark` for Markdown, `-port` as in porting - and as in harbour.
>
> Internal identifiers keep the old string on purpose: `localStorage` keys and the layout plugin's `id` are unchanged, so existing vaults and preferences keep working. Historical notes under `docs/` also still say `obsidian-web`, because that is what the project was called then.

**There is no public instance.** Hosting one would mean serving Obsidian's own application code
to strangers, and that is Obsidian's call to make. This repository does not contain or
redistribute their bundle either - the setup script downloads it from Obsidian, onto your machine.

**[How to run your own →](https://markport.pages.dev/install)**

In the client-only mode, your vault lives in your browser (OPFS) or in a folder you pick on disk;
nothing is stored on a server. The optional Node.js server mode stores vaults on the server's
filesystem.

Markport loads Obsidian's original renderer (`app.js`) completely unmodified - zero build-time patches; all platform behaviour (mobile vs. desktop layout) is adjusted at runtime via `client-mobile/platform-bridge.js`, not by rewriting the bundle - and replaces every Node.js / Capacitor / Electron dependency it depends on with lightweight browser-compatible shims. The result is real Obsidian running in any modern browser.

### What works

- Full Markdown editing and preview (CodeMirror + Obsidian's renderer)
- File tree, tabs, split panes, graph view
- Bidirectional links and backlinks
- Search and command palette
- Core plugins (file explorer, tags, bookmarks, outgoing links, etc.)
- Real-time sync across tabs via WebSocket - **Node.js server mode only** (`/api/watch`); not available in the client-only (OPFS) deployment, which has no server to push events from
- RTL / Unicode support

### Fast bootstrap (Node.js server mode)

Against the Node.js server, the browser version can load faster than the desktop app. Instead of Obsidian reading dozens of config files one by one from disk, everything is served in a single HTTP request (`/api/bootstrap`) - all files, directories, and metadata arrive at once, before Obsidian even starts running. When it calls `statSync` or `readFileSync`, the answer is already waiting in memory. **The client-only (OPFS) deployment doesn't use this path** - there's no HTTP round-trip for vault reads at all; the vault is read directly from the browser's local storage.

### Browser support (OPFS)

The client-only deployment (and local/folder vaults on the Node server) are backed by
[OPFS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system)
(Origin Private File System). Support varies by browser:

| Capability | Chromium | Firefox | Safari |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Vault storage - read (`getDirectory`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vault storage - write (`createWritable`) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ shipped much later than `getDirectory` - check your Safari version before relying on it |
| Folder vaults (`showDirectoryPicker`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Auto-refresh on external folder change (`FileSystemObserver`) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ - falls back to refresh on tab focus |

**OPFS requires a secure context** (`https://` or `localhost`). Over plain HTTP on a bare IP address, `navigator.storage.getDirectory` is `undefined` and vault creation fails silently - this applies to local development too, not just production.

### Two deployment modes

| | **Node.js server** | **Cloudflare (client-only)** |
|---|---|---|
| Path | `src/runtime-server/server/` | `src/deployments/cloudflare/` |
| Storage | Real filesystem, via `/api/fs` | OPFS - entirely inside your browser |
| Persistence | Full | Until you clear this site's browsing data |
| Sharing | Whoever can reach the server/port | Nobody - your vault stays private to your browser; only GitHub/obsidian.md requests (plugin installs, plus one automatic check on vault load) pass through a small proxy, see "Cloudflare (client-only) deployment" below |
| Use case | Personal use, self-hosted | Static hosting, zero maintenance, no server-side vault storage |
| URL | `http://localhost:3000` | wherever you deploy it |

The **Vercel deployment** (`src/deployments/vercel/`) is the client-only storage model with one
addition: the same `/sync/v1` protocol served as serverless functions, with sync state in Neon
Postgres - so several devices can **push to and pull from** one shared vault (edits, deletions,
conflicts). The Cloudflare deployment ships the same app without that endpoint. See "Vercel
(client-only + sync) deployment" below.

The app profile and the demo profile come from **one build**. `scripts/build-assets.sh` picks a config profile
from the `OW_PROFILE` environment variable - the default profile ships the app (no demo vault, no
seeding), `OW_PROFILE=demo` ships the demo (seeded example vault, opened automatically, re-seeded
when the shipped content changes). A guard script refuses to upload an artifact to the wrong
target. See `src/deployments/cloudflare/README.md`.

There's also `src/sync-server/` - a separate, optional pull-sync server (`/sync/v1`, content-hash
based, Bearer-token auth via `SYNC_TOKEN`) that lets an OPFS vault pull from a server-hosted vault
directory. It's not part of either deployment above - see `src/sync-server/README.md`. The Vercel
deployment speaks the same protocol (and implements the push half that this server stubs), so one
wire format works across every backend.

### Requirements

Node 18+ or Bun. Most packages' scripts invoke `node` (`src/client-mobile` tests, the
`runtime-server` backend, the Cloudflare deployment's build script); `src/sync-server` is the one
package that runs on `bun` (`bun index.js` / `bun test`).

## Setup (Node.js server)

Download and extract the Obsidian mobile renderer bundle (the only runtime the server serves):

```bash
node scripts/update-obsidian-mobile.js --version 1.12.7 && node scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js
```

Install and run the backend:

```bash
cd src/runtime-server/server
npm install
npm run dev   # auto-reloads on file changes (uses node --watch)
```

For production (no reload overhead):
```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. `/mobile` also works (backwards-compatible alias, same page).
`/starter` (the old desktop vault picker) returns the same app shell as `/` on the Node
server - `GET /starter` is a 200, not a redirect - so existing bookmarks/links still land
you on the app instead of a 404. The client-only Cloudflare deployment serves `/starter`
too, via its own Worker route (`index.js`) that returns the same app shell - see
"Cloudflare (client-only) deployment" below; that deployment is not a plain static host.

`/mobile` is **not** part of the Cloudflare (client-only) deployment - it's a route this Node
server adds; the static deployment's Worker serves `/`, `/starter`, `/vault/*`, and
`/api/proxy-request` (see "Cloudflare (client-only) deployment" below), but not `/mobile`.

## Obsidian Version

> **Supported version: 1.12.7.** Obsidian 1.13 added a startup check that Markport
> deliberately does not satisfy, so 1.13+ will not load - you'll get an explanatory screen instead
> of the app. This is a decision, not an outstanding bug. **Pass `--version 1.12.7` explicitly**;
> the commands below default to the latest release, which will not work.
> Full explanation and what was measured: [`docs/obsidian-version-support.md`](docs/obsidian-version-support.md).

### Mobile bundle (`vendor/obsidian-mobile/`) - the only runtime

`/` and `/mobile` are both served by the mobile runtime, which needs the Obsidian Android APK bundle extracted into `vendor/obsidian-mobile/`. Like the (now vestigial) `vendor/obsidian-desktop/`, this directory is gitignored and downloaded on demand:

```bash
# the supported version - use this one
node scripts/update-obsidian-mobile.js --version 1.12.7

# latest Android APK release - currently 1.13+, which will NOT boot (see the note above)
node scripts/update-obsidian-mobile.js
```

This script downloads the official APK and unpacks the `assets/public/` tree to `vendor/obsidian-mobile/` - **zero build-time patches are applied**; the extracted bundle is byte-for-byte identical to Obsidian's own Android renderer. All platform behaviour - exposing `window.__owPlatform` and merging `window.__owPlatformOverrides` into the live `Platform` flags, including the desktop-layout vault-profile panel - happens at runtime via `client-mobile/platform-bridge.js`, which intercepts `Object.defineProperty` instead of touching a single byte of app.js. `scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js` still runs as part of the update step - its patch list is currently empty, kept as infrastructure in case a future Obsidian version needs one; if a future patch's regex fails to match, the script aborts loudly, same as before.

| Runtime URL | Updater |
|---|---|
| `/` | `node scripts/update-obsidian-mobile.js --version 1.12.7 && node scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js` |
| `/mobile` (alias) | same as `/` - identical `index.html` |

## Configuration

Server environment variables:

- `PORT`: HTTP port, default `3000`.
- `HOST`: bind address, default `127.0.0.1`.
- `VAULT_PATH`: vault path relative to the project root or absolute, default `user-data/demo-vault`.
- `VAULT_REGISTRY`: recent-vault registry JSON path, default `user-data/registry.json`.

### Bootstrap configuration

The `/api/bootstrap` endpoint preloads vault content into memory for fast
boot. Both `/` and `/mobile` (the same runtime) consume it. Defaults work
for most vaults. To customize:

- `BOOTSTRAP_DISABLED=true` - skip the bootstrap entirely. Each FS read
  goes individually over HTTP. Useful for minimal deployments where the
  precompute is not worth it. Cold boot of a large vault drops back to
  ~20s; with bootstrap enabled it is ~2-3s.
- `BOOTSTRAP_MAX_FILE_KB=500` - skip individual files larger than this
  from the cache (default: 500 KB). Their stat is still cached; content
  is fetched on demand.
- `BOOTSTRAP_MAX_TOTAL_MB=50` - cap the total uncompressed response size
  (default: 50 MB). When reached, server stops adding content but still
  returns dirs+stat for the remaining files. Response carries
  `capped: true` and `cappedReason`.

## Deployment

## Cloudflare (client-only) deployment (`src/deployments/cloudflare/`)

A static deployment that runs entirely on Cloudflare's edge. Vaults live in the browser (OPFS) -
there is **no server-side vault storage of any kind** here (the old server-side in-memory vault
store, internally called `VaultDO`, was removed). A small Worker (`index.js`) still handles two
things a plain static host can't:

- `POST /api/proxy-request` - a CORS-safe edge proxy that routes `github.com`/
  `githubusercontent.com`/`obsidian.md` requests (community-plugin installs, plus one
  automatic deprecated-plugins check on vault load - those hosts don't send CORS headers).
  A sync server or any other host is never routed through it
- `GET /starter` and `/vault/*` - SPA-fallback routes that return the same app shell as `/`, so
  deep links and bookmarks don't 404

Everything else is served as a static asset (`env.ASSETS`). See
`src/deployments/cloudflare/README.md` for the full picture (system plugins, proxy caching, known
gaps).

```bash
cd src/deployments/cloudflare
npm install
npm run build   # scripts/build-assets.sh → .tmp/deployments/cloudflare/public
npm run dev     # local emulation (wrangler pages dev) - does NOT publish anywhere
```

`npm run build` needs network access (GitHub API + release-asset CDN) to fetch the LiveSync
plugin on a cold cache; if unreachable, it **warns and continues** without LiveSync rather than
failing the build.

Two publish commands, each carrying its own destination:

| Command | Publishes |
|---|---|
| `npm run deploy` | the app, to branch `main` of your project |
| `npm run deploy:demo` | the demo, to branch `demo` |

Both read the target from `CF_PAGES_PROJECT` and fail if it is unset - there is no default,
because there is no instance for this project to publish to.

Both rebuild from source first and run a guard that refuses to upload a demo artifact to the
app target (or the reverse). Only run them when you actually intend to publish; use
`npm run dev` for local testing.

### Architecture

```
Browser
  ├─ vault storage: OPFS (client-side only, never leaves the browser)
  └─ HTTP → CF Worker (index.js)
              ├─ POST /api/proxy-request  → edge proxy (GitHub/obsidian.md, CORS)
              ├─ GET /starter, /vault/*   → same app shell as / (SPA fallback)
              └─ everything else          → static assets (CF CDN)
```

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/index.js` | Worker entry: `/api/proxy-request` + `/starter`/`/vault/*` fallback, else static assets |
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/proxy-worker.js` | The CORS-safe outbound proxy implementation |
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/template.js` | Demo vault content - seeded client-side into a new visitor's own OPFS vault on first visit |
| `src/config/deploy-config.json` / `deploy-config.demo.json` | The two build profiles - app and demo (`OW_PROFILE`) |
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/scripts/guard-deploy-target.sh` | Refuses to publish an artifact to the wrong target |
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/scripts/build-assets.sh` | Build: copies the mobile bundle, builds the system-plugins manifest + example-vault JSON |
| `src/deployments/cloudflare/test/` | `bun test` - proxy + build-assets tests |
| `.tmp/deployments/cloudflare/public/...` | Built static assets (generated by `npm run build`) |

---

## Vercel (client-only + sync) deployment (`src/deployments/vercel/`)

The same browser-only app as the Cloudflare deployment, plus `/sync/v1` served as serverless
functions with Neon Postgres behind them - so an OPFS vault on device A syncs **both ways** with
the same vault on device B: edits, deletions, and conflicts (the server wins at the original
path; the losing side is preserved as a `name.conflict-<timestamp>.ext` file - nothing is ever
silently overwritten). Vault content itself still lives in each browser's OPFS; Postgres holds
the shared sync state (blobs + file table), not a server-side vault you browse.

Also served: `POST /api/proxy-request` (the same allow-listed GitHub/obsidian.md proxy, ported
from the Cloudflare Worker) and the `/starter`, `/vault/*` SPA-fallback routes (via
`vercel.json` rewrites). Everything else is static.

```bash
cd src/deployments/vercel
npm install
npm run build   # scripts/build-assets.js -> public/ (same copies + markers as the CF build)
npm run dev     # local server with the real handlers (memory store, prints a dev token)
npm test        # node --test: protocol, stores, proxy, adapter, fixture build
```

A deployment needs two environment variables: `SYNC_TOKEN` (devices authenticate with it;
**unset means every sync request answers 503** - fail-closed on purpose) and `DATABASE_URL`
(the Neon pooled connection string). The client-side config is the same `localStorage`
`ow-sync:<vaultId>` key as pull-sync. Full setup, Vercel's 4.5 MB chunking story, and the
conflict rules: `src/deployments/vercel/README.md`.

## Node.js deployment

The Node.js server (`src/runtime-server/server/`) can be deployed to any Linux box. A typical setup:

1. Clone the repo and run `node scripts/update-obsidian-mobile.js --version 1.12.7 && node scripts/patch-obsidian-mobile.js` to get Obsidian's renderer files
2. `cd src/runtime-server/server && npm install && npm start`
3. Put it behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel) with HTTPS
4. Do not expose the server directly to the internet without auth - there is no application-level authentication

## Notes

- Obsidian's extracted files are treated as third-party artifacts. Do not edit files under `vendor/obsidian-mobile/`; update wrappers/shims instead.
- The default vault is `user-data/demo-vault/`.
- Do not bind the server to a public IP without a tunnel or auth layer in front.
- See `docs/architecture.md` for the current architecture and design principles.
- `vendor/obsidian-desktop/` and `scripts/update-obsidian-desktop.js` (the legacy desktop renderer + its
  downloader) are **vestigial** - the server no longer serves any route from them (removed
  in the `collapse-desktop` slice). They are left in place rather than deleted; if you don't
  already have `vendor/obsidian-desktop/` populated, you don't need it - everything now runs on
  `vendor/obsidian-mobile/`.
